Java Developer Assignment
=========================

This document outlines the specification of a TCP/IP socket server and client. Your task is to 
develop a simple TCP/IP socket server based on specifications and also a client to send subsequent 
requests to the server.

TCP/IP Socket Server
--------------------
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 
The socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is 
destined to be sent to.

You can find an example of Java Socket Server here.

In server application, there is a class called `PrimeCalculationManager` which returns the count of 
prime numbers less or equal to the given input n. There might be lots of other manager classes like this.

Our desired socket server should be able to handle subsequent requests from clients. So one specification 
of the socket server would be, it must be able to handle incoming requests in parallel.

TCP/IP Socket Client
--------------------
A client can establish a socket connection to the server and send/receive messages. 
Here is an example of a TCP/IP socket client.

Our desired client will send requests to the server with the `RequestObject`.

For example, if I want to get the count of prime numbers less than or equal to 100, it should 
have request object like following:
```
{
    "method":"findPrimes",
    "managerName":"PrimeCalculationManager",
    "args":{"n":"100"}
}
```

Tasks
-----
The goal of this project is to develop a socket server which will receive incoming requests from clients. 
The incoming requests object will have 3 parameters.
- managerName: The server will instantiate an instance of the manager class from the managerName. 
  Here we have a constraint. We have to instantiate the manager class using reflection.
- method: It denotes which method we need to call for that specific manager. Here we will also have 
  the same constraint. We will get the method using reflection and invoke later.
- args: Denotes the arguments need to invoke the method.

So the server will execute the requested method with provided arguments and will return the result 
to the client.
